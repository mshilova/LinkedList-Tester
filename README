Followed test-driven development

List12Tester.java is testing the java.util.List<E> interface using 
the JUnit Testing Framework.

List12.java is a class that implements the java.util.List<E> interface.
This implementation is using a singly-linked list with a head pointer 
(i.e. a pointer, in the List object itself, to the first element of the list),
but no tail pointer.
